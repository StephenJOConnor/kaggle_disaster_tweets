# kaggle_disaster_tweets

Models prepared for the Kaggle Disaster Tweets competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/overview. 

The purpose of the competition is to develop an NLP model to distinguish disaster-related tweets from non-disaster-related tweets. My transfer learning models are built in Python using the scikit-learn, PyTorch, fast.ai and transformers libraries. 

Final ULMFIT model achieved a F1 accuracy score of 0.82208, a score in the 72nd percentile at time of writing. 

BERT/RoBERTa model to come soon.
